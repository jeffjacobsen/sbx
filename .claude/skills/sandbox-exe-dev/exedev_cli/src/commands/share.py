"""
exedev share — port exposure & access control (mostly unique-to-exe.dev).

Every VM gets a URL for free, but exe.dev's are
by default (`get-host` returns a URL anyone can hit); exe.dev URLs are
**private-by-default** behind an exe.dev login proxy. To make one
"anyone with the URL can hit it" behaviour, run:

    exedev share set-public <vm>

We also expose `share get-host` for ergonomic parity with `sbx sandbox get-host`.
The exe.dev URL is **deterministic** — it's always:

    https://<vm>.exe.xyz/         (primary port, set with `share port <vm> <p>`)
    https://<vm>.exe.xyz:<p>/     (any auth-only alt port in 3000-9999)

…so `get-host` doesn't actually call out; it composes the URL locally.
